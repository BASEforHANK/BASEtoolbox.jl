The topics covered include:</p><ul><li>The <a href="#algorithm-of-the-endogenous-grid-method">Endogenous Grid Point Method</a> for solving the household problem.</li><li>Aggregation of the household side using <a href="#aggregation-via-non-stochastic-simulations">non-stochastic simulations</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="Algorithm-of-the-Endogenous-Grid-Method"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Algorithm-of-the-Endogenous-Grid-Method">Algorithm of the Endogenous Grid Method</a><a id="Algorithm-of-the-Endogenous-Grid-Method-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Algorithm-of-the-Endogenous-Grid-Method" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>We use the Endogenous Grid Method to solve for optimal policies, given marginal continuation values <code>EWb</code>, <code>EWk</code>, today&#39;s prices and income. Having established the required equations in <a href="../HouseholdProblem/"><code>HouseholdProblem</code></a>, we can now illustrate the algorithm in detail. We use a version of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188910000928">Hintermaier and Koeniger (2010)</a> extension of the endogenous grid method, originally developed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176505003368?via%3Dihub">Carroll (2006)</a>. Intuitively, instead of determining asset and consumption choices simultaneously, we fix asset policies on predefined (exogenous) grid points for the future. We then identify the consumption policy associated with these asset policies and calculate the required resources, known as endogenous grid points, for the household to achieve these policies. Finally, we interpolate the derived policy functions from the endogenous grid points back onto the exogenous grids of the discretized state space.</p><p>The algorithm works iteratively until convergence of continuation values as follows:</p><ol><li><p>Guess <a href="#0-initial-guesses-for-the-marginal-values">initial marginal continuation values</a> (CV1) and (CV2) (in <code>fcn_kdiff.jl</code>).</p></li><li><p><a href="#1-compute-the-expected-value-of-the-continuation-values">Compute the expected values</a> of the continuation values (CV1) and (CV2) (in <code>fcn_ksupply.jl</code>).</p></li><li><p><a href="#2-update-the-optimal-policy-functions">Update the optimal policies</a> given the expected marginal continuation values using the FOCs (in <code>EGM_policyupdate.jl</code>)</p><p>a.

We will use the expressions <span>$\vec b$</span>, <span>$\vec k$</span>, and <span>$\vec h$</span> for the exogenously given vectors over which we discretize the continuous state space. Let <span>$n_b$</span>, <span>$n_k$</span>, and <span>$n_h$</span> denote the sizes of the grids <span>$\vec b$</span>, <span>$\vec k$</span>, and <span>$\vec h$</span>, respectively. For the sake of illustrating the algorithm, we use the superscript <span>$m$</span> as a placeholder for the current iteration.</p><h3 id="0.-Initial-guesses-for-the-marginal-values"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#0.-Initial-guesses-for-the-marginal-values">0. Initial guesses for the marginal values</a><a id="0.-Initial-guesses-for-the-marginal-values-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#0.-Initial-guesses-for-the-marginal-values" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>To run the algorithm, we require guesses for the marginal values. These guesses are specified in <code>fcn_kdiff.jl</code>. We calculate them based on a very simple initial guess for the policy function of consumption <span>$x^{\text{guess}}$</span></p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{align*}
x^{\text{guess}} &amp;= y(h) + RR(b) b \times 1\{b &gt; 0\} + r^K k  \times 1\{k &gt; 0\},
\end{align*}\]</p><p>where we have summarized all different labor income types in the variable <span>$y(h) = \left(\frac{\tau^p + \gamma}{1+\gamma}\right) y^n + 1\{h_{it} \neq 0\}(1- \tau)\Pi^U + 1\{h_{it} = 0\} f_\tau(\Pi^E)$</span>. For the calculation of the guess, we have used the exogenous grid values. The consumption guess <span>$x^{\text{guess}}$</span> serves as an upper bound for the policy function, assuming the household consumes the entire cash-at-hand in the non-adjustment case. We use this guess for the policy function in both the adjustment and non-adjustment cases.</p><p>Based on this guess, we calculate the guesses for the continuation values</p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \mathbb W^0}{\partial k} (b, k, h) &amp;= (1 + r^k + \lambda) \frac{\partial u(x^{guess})}{\partial x}, \\
\frac{\partial \mathbb W^0}{\partial b} (b, k, h) &amp;= RR(b) \frac{\partial u(x^{guess})}{\partial x}, \\
\end{align*}\]</p><p>where the superscripts at <span>$\frac{\partial \mathbb W^0}{\partial k}$</span> and <span>$\frac{\partial \mathbb W^0}{\partial b}$</span> denote the iteration of the marginal value, with <span>$0$</span> indicating the initial guess. Note that this is not in line with the equations (CV1) and (CV2), but it is an <strong>assumption</strong> we make for the initial guesses of the marginal values.</p><p>These guesses are then used in <code>fcn_ksupply.jl</code> as input in the function <code>Ksupply</code>. The latter function hosts the actual calculation of the household policy functions within a loop. Steps 1-4 below illustrate the individual steps to find the policy functions.</p><p>In line with the notation above, we will use superscripts on the continuation values (CV1) and (CV2) to indicate the iteration in which these were computed.</p><h3 id="1.-Compute-the-expected-value-of-the-continuation-values"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#1.-Compute-the-expected-value-of-the-continuation-values">1.

\end{align*}\]</p><p>Concretely, we use the transition matrix <span>$\Pi(h, h&#39;)$</span> to weight future continuation values by the probability to transit into the future productivity state <span>$h&#39;$</span>, given the productivity state <span>$h$</span> today and sum over all potential realizations of future productivity states <span>$h&#39;$</span>. Note that by taking expectations over future productivity levels, <span>$h&#39;$</span>, the expected continuation value becomes a function of todays productivity state <span>$h$</span>.</p><p>The code executes the calculation of this continuation value using <code>BLAS.gemm!</code>.

The update of the policy functions is done in <code>EGM_policyupdate.jl</code> in the function <code>EGM_policyupdate!</code>. The calculation is done in several steps that have several substeps themselves which reflect that the household is either able to trade illiquid assets (adjustment case) or not (non-adjustment case):</p><p>a) Find optimal liquid asset policy in the non-adjustment case.</p><p>b) Find optimal portfolio combination in the adjustment case.</p><p>c) Standard backward EGM step given the optimal portfolio choice.</p><p>We will illustrate each of these steps in detail below.</p><h4 id="a)-Find-optimal-liquid-asset-policy-in-the-non-adjustment-case"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#a)-Find-optimal-liquid-asset-policy-in-the-non-adjustment-case">a) Find optimal liquid asset policy in the non-adjustment case</a><a id="a)-Find-optimal-liquid-asset-policy-in-the-non-adjustment-case-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#a)-Find-optimal-liquid-asset-policy-in-the-non-adjustment-case" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>In the non-adjustment case, household face a consumption-saving decision with idiosyncratic risk over the income states in the next period. The core equation is (FOC3), which we repeat here for convenience:</p><p class="math-container">\[\frac{\partial u(x^{*}_{n})}{\partial x} \geq (1 + \tau^c) \beta \, \mathbb E \, \frac{\partial W^{m-1}}{\partial b} (b^{*}_{n}, k, h&#39;) \equiv EMU (b^{*}_{n}, k, h&#39;). \tag{FOC3}\]</p><p>Here, we have defined <span>$EMU$</span> for reference below. The relevant substeps to find updates for the policy functions are</p><p>i) Calculate the right-hand-side of (FOC3).</p><p>ii) Apply the inverse of the marginal utility function to the right-hand-side of (FOC3).</p><p>iii) Find the endogenous grid points associated with the policy choice.</p><p>iv) Interpolate back from the endogenous grid onto the exogenous grid.</p><p>v) Ensure that the borrowing constraint is respected.</p><p>We will use the right-hand-side of equation (FOC3), but instead of defining it on the grid <span>$(b^{*}_{n}, k, h&#39;)$</span>, we will evaluate it on the exogenously fixed grid <span>$(b&#39;, k&#39;, h&#39;)$</span>. This means we evaluate the continuation value at fixed asset choices on the exogenous grid <span>$b&#39;$</span> for the next period and calculate the optimal corresponding consumption choice for today. Given the fixed savings choice and the corresponding optimal consumption, we can then calculate the endogenous grid points, which are the resources associated with these plans. Using these endogenous grid points, we can interpolate our policy functions from the endogenous grid to the exogenous grid. Each of these steps is explained on the following.</p><h5 id="i)-Calculate-the-right-hand-side-of-(FOC3),-EMU"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#i)-Calculate-the-right-hand-side-of-(FOC3),-EMU">i) Calculate the right-hand-side of (FOC3), <span>$EMU$</span></a><a id="i)-Calculate-the-right-hand-side-of-(FOC3),-EMU-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#i)-Calculate-the-right-hand-side-of-(FOC3),-EMU" title="Permalink"></a></h5><p>From the last iteration of the endogenous grid point method, we obtained the continuation value (CV2), <code>EWb</code>, which enters the right-hand-side of (FOC3). Since the right-hand-side expression will be used in several places of the algorithm, we calculate it as one expression and save it to a variable denoted <code>EMU</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-Julia hljs">EMU .= EWb .* β .* (1.0 .+ τc)</code></pre><p><code>EWb</code> denotes the expected marginal utility of the liquid asset that we computed in step 1 above and enters the function <code>EGM_policyupdate</code> as an argument. <code>τc</code> is the consumption tax rate today, which affects the optimal consumption schedule by altering the intertemporal price of consumption. As a result, we can express (FOC3) as</p><p class="math-container">\[\frac{\partial u(x^{*}_{n})}{\partial x} \geq EMU (b^{*}_{n}, k, h&#39;).\]</p><h5 id="ii)-Apply-the-inverse-of-the-marginal-utility-function-to-the-right-hand-side-of-(FOC3)"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#ii)-Apply-the-inverse-of-the-marginal-utility-function-to-the-right-hand-side-of-(FOC3)">ii) Apply the inverse of the marginal utility function to the right-hand-side of (FOC3)</a><a id="ii)-Apply-the-inverse-of-the-marginal-utility-function-to-the-right-hand-side-of-(FOC3)-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#ii)-Apply-the-inverse-of-the-marginal-utility-function-to-the-right-hand-side-of-(FOC3)" title="Permalink"></a></h5><p>Assume for now that this holds with equality, and let <span>$\tilde b$</span> denote the so-called endogenous grid of the liquid asset today. The endogenous grid is the level of the liquid asset today that makes the household choose liquid assets <span>$b&#39;$</span> tomorrow (which we will fix to be on the exogenous grid <span>$\vec b$</span>). With the endogenous grid, we can apply the inverse of the marginal utility</p><p class="math-container">\[x^*_n(\tilde b, k, h) =(u&#39;)^{-1}(EMU (b&#39;, k, h&#39;)),\]</p><p>which denotes the consumption policy function today at the endogenous gridpoints <span>$\tilde b$</span>.

In the code the inversion is handled by</p><pre><code class="language-Julia hljs">invmutil!(x_tilde_n, EMU, m_par)</code></pre><h5 id="iii)-Find-the-endogenous-grid-points-associated-with-the-policy-choice"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#iii)-Find-the-endogenous-grid-points-associated-with-the-policy-choice">iii) Find the endogenous grid points associated with the policy choice</a><a id="iii)-Find-the-endogenous-grid-points-associated-with-the-policy-choice-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#iii)-Find-the-endogenous-grid-points-associated-with-the-policy-choice" title="Permalink"></a></h5><p>In the former step, we obtained the policy function defined on the endogenous grid <span>$\tilde b$</span>, but haven&#39;t explicitly calculated the values of the endogenous grid <span>$\tilde b$</span> that are consistent with assets tomorrow and the respective policy optimal choice of consumption today. We cannot use the policy function on the endogenous grid, but require it on the exogenous grid of the liquid asset, <span>$b$</span>. Therefore, we will interpolate the policy function from the endogenous grid onto the exogenous grid in step iv). To do so, we first have to calculate the values of the endogenous grid in this step.</p><p>We find the values of the endogenous grid points by using the budget constraint of the household in the non-adjustment case and using that the endogenous grid points being the level of liquid assets today that makes the household choose policies <span>$b^*_n(\tilde b, k, h) = b&#39;$</span> and <span>$x^*_n (\tilde b, k, h)$</span>. Plugging the policy functions into the budget constraint, we then obtain</p><p class="math-container">\[(1+\tau^c) x(\tilde b, k, h) + b&#39; = y(h) + \tilde RR(\tilde b) b + r^K k,\]</p><p>where we used <span>$y(h) = \left(\frac{\tau^p + \gamma}{1+\gamma}\right) y^n + 1\{h_{it} \neq 0\}(1- \tau)\Pi^U + 1\{h_{it} = 0\} f_\tau(\Pi^E)$</span> to summarize all non-asset income of the household. Note that the endogenous grid points <span>$\tilde b$</span> show up on the left-hand-side as the definition points of the policy functions <span>$x^*_n$</span> and <span>$b&#39;$</span> (which should be a policy function, but we have fixed the potential choices for liquid assets on the grid), as well as on the right-hand-side as a source of (liquid asset) income. We know the values of the policy functions on the left-hand-side of the budget constraint, such that we can solve for the endogenous grid points</p><p class="math-container">\[\tilde b (b&#39;, k, h) = \frac{1}{RR(\tilde b)} \left[(1+\tau^c) x(\tilde b, k, h) + b&#39; - y(h) - r^K k \right]. \tag{end. grid non-adj.}\]</p><p>Note that the endogenous grid point is a function of todays illiquid asset, <span>$k$</span> (which is also tomorrows illiquid asset given non-adjustment), as well as the productivity state <span>$h$</span>, because we have conditionalized in each of the above steps on these states. For the calculation of the endogenous grid points, we evaluate the illiquid capital and the productivity states on the exogenous grids <span>$\vec k$</span> and <span>$\vec h$</span>.</p><p>The real interest rate on liquid assets <span>$RR(\tilde b)$</span> can depend on the level of the endogenous grid points. In the baseline case, we have a spread between the lending and borrowing rate, such that only the sign of <span>$\tilde b$</span> is relevant to determine the correct interest rate to be applied. In the code <code>b_tilde_n</code> denotes the endogenous grid of liquid assets, and <code>eff_int</code> is the correct interest rate, which is applied depending on the sign of the endogenous grid.</p><pre><code class="language-Julia hljs">b_tilde_n .= (

Next, we address the scenario where households are constrained in the illiquid asset.</p><p>When finding the optimal portfolio combination, we also considered the case where <span>$k&#39;=0$</span>. Thus, we have already identified an optimal portfolio for households constrained in the illiquid asset, specifically <span>$(\hat b^*_a(0, h), 0)$</span>. However, this combination may not be the only optimal holding of liquid assets when households choose not to save in the illiquid asset. The following figure illustrates why this is the case.</p><p><img src="../Tikz_Graph.png" alt="image"/></p><p>Figure 1 illustrates the optimal combination of savings in liquid and illiquid assets for two values of <span>$h$</span>. The solid blue line represents the optimal levels of the liquid asset <span>$b_a^*(k&#39;, h)$</span> for different levels of <span>$k&#39;$</span>, corresponding to the combinations obtained in step iii). The solid red line shows alternative liquid asset choices that households might consider when <span>$k&#39;=0$</span>. The red line indicates values on the grid of the liquid asset <span>$b&#39;$</span>, which satisfy <span>$0 \leq b&#39; &lt; \hat b^*_a(0, h_1)$</span> and still be optimal for the household given corresponding endogenous resources. Such choices might emerge if the illiquid asset is very undesirable to hold, meaning the household is constrained in its illiquid asset choice but not in its liquid asset choice.</p><p>This step is crucial because, in dynamic programming, we need to determine the optimal choices when the household is constrained in the illiquid asset to define the policy function across the entire state space. If points on the red line exist, we have not covered this case. From the perspective of implementing the EGM algorithm, during the EGM step, we must condition on all optimal future asset holdings. In the non-adjustment case, this is straightforward by conditioning on the exogenous grid <span>$\vec b$</span>. However, in the adjustment case, this is more complex as we need to condition on the optimal portfolio choice. The red line represents portfolio choices in the liquid asset, conditional on <span>$k&#39; = 0$</span>, which might still be optimal for the household but were not identified in step iii). Therefore, we must identify the policy functions on the endogenous grid today that correspond to the asset choices on the red line and find the endogenous grid points associated with these choices. This completes the array of endogenous grid points from which we interpolate policy functions onto the exogenous grid.</p><p>To verify whether there exist values on the exogenous grid <span>$\vec b$</span> that were not covered in step iii) (i.e., are located on the red line in Figure 1), we need to check for all values of <span>$h \in \vec h$</span>. Conditional on a productivity level <span>$h$</span>, we check whether there exist values on the exogenous grid <span>$\vec b$</span> that satisfy <span>$b&#39; &lt; b^*_a(0, h)$</span>. If such values exist, we have identified points where households are constrained in their illiquid asset choice but still prefer to hold liquid assets below <span>$b^*_a(0, h)$</span> given their endogenous resources. If no such values exist, all liquid asset choices on the exogenous grid were already covered in step iii). We illustrate this case with the dotted blue line in Figure 1, where <span>$\hat{b}^*_a(0, h_2)=\underline{B}$</span>.</p><p>The code checks whether there exists liquid asset values as on the red line using an <code>if</code> condition. Note that <code>b_hat_a[1, :]</code> corresponds to the optimal liquid asset choice <span>$b^*_a(0, h)$</span> conditional on <span>$k&#39;=0$</span> for all <span>$n_h$</span> values of productivity. It is thus a vector of dimension <span>$n_h$</span>:</p><pre><code class="language-Julia hljs">b_star_zero = b_hat_a[1, :]</code></pre><p>We loop over all productivity states <code>j=1:nh</code> as follows. There are two cases for the optimal portfolio choice of liquid assets under a binding illiquid assets constraint. In the first case, the lowest grid point on the exogenous grid <span>$\vec b$</span> is below the optimal choice <span>$b^*_a(0, h)$</span>, so:</p><pre><code class="language-Julia hljs">b_star_zero[j] &gt; n_par.grid_b[1]</code></pre><p>is true. This indicates the existence of points on the red line in Figure 1. We need to address these points and determine the optimal consumption choices and endogenous grid points associated with these grid points. First, we identify the grid points on the exogenous grid <span>$\vec b$</span> that are below the interior choice <span>$b^*_a(0, h)$</span>. Then, we apply the same logic as in the EGM step for the non-adjustment case. We use the first-order condition (FOC2), condition on the identified grid points in <span>$\vec b$</span> and <span>$k&#39;=0$</span>, and invert the first-order condition to find the optimal corresponding consumption policy. Using the computed policy for consumption, as well as liquid and illiquid savings (<span>$k&#39;=0$</span>), we then compute the endogenous grid points.</p><p>Since all asset choices are on the exogenous grid, we do not need to interpolate the continuation value on the right-hand-side of (FOC2). Additionally, we do not need to apply the inverse of the marginal utility to the right-hand-side of (FOC2) because we have already calculated these expressions in step ii) in a), the EGM step for the non-adjustment case. Therefore, we can directly use the consumption function on the endogenous grid <code>x_tilde_n</code> obtained in the non-adjustment case as the relevant policy function.</p><p>The intuition for us to use the consumption function from the non-adjustment case is that <span>$k=k&#39;$</span> (the non-adjustment case) and <span>$k&#39;=0$</span> (in the adjustment case) are equivalent as soon as we express everything in terms of the endogenous grid points (resources). This can be seen by looking at the value functions from the very beginning:</p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{align*}
    V^a (b,k,h) &amp;= \max_{k&#39;,b&#39; \in \Gamma_{a}}  u[x(b,b_{a}&#39;,k,k&#39;,h)] + \beta \, \mathbb E \, \mathbb W (b&#39;,k&#39;,h&#39;), \\
    V^n (b,k,h) &amp;= \max_{b&#39; \in \Gamma_{n}}  u[x(b,b_{n}&#39;,k,k,h)] + \beta \, \mathbb E \, \mathbb W(b&#39;,k,h&#39;).
\end{align*}\]</p><p>If we collect the contemporaneous <span>$b$</span>, and <span>$k$</span> terms in the term <span>$\mathcal{R}$</span> and noting that for the adjustment case, we know that <span>$k&#39;=0$</span>, then</p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{align*}
    V^a (\mathcal{R}, h) &amp;= \max_{b&#39; \in \Gamma_{a}}  u[x(\mathcal{R},b_{a}&#39;,0, h)] + \beta \, \mathbb E \, \mathbb W (b&#39;,0,h&#39;), \\
    V^n (\mathcal{R}, h) &amp;= \max_{b&#39; \in \Gamma_{n}}  u[x(\mathcal{R},b_{n}&#39;,k, h)] + \beta \, \mathbb E \, \mathbb W(b&#39;,k,h&#39;),
\end{align*}\]</p><p>so that using the results from the non-adjustment case for <span>$k=0$</span> is equivalent since, conditional on the resources, also the budget sets are identical then.</p><p>Consequently, we reuse the consumption function and save it in a new variable for reference in the following code.</p><pre><code class="language-Julia hljs">aux_x = reshape(x_tilde_n[:, 1, :], (nb, nh))</code></pre><p>We do the same with net labor income, which only depends on the productivity state.</p><pre><code class="language-Julia hljs">aux_inc = reshape(net_labor_union_inc_GHH[1, 1, :], (1, nh))</code></pre><p><strong>Technical note:</strong> In the code, we now save the results of the endogenous grid algorithm in lists.

Young introduces a method that replaces traditional stochastic simulations with a non-stochastic counterpart. Instead of approximating the distributions of households by simulating a large cross-section of households stochastically, Young&#39;s method directly simulates the distribution of households. This approach involves iterating on a fixed grid of points to approximate the distribution of individual states, thereby eliminating the sampling variability inherent in stochastic simulations. The non-stochastic simulation aims to improve computational efficiency and accuracy in solving models with heterogeneous agents.</p><p>Below, we will illustrate the idea of Young&#39;s method based on the household problem of a Krusell and Smith economy as in the original paper. We will demonstrate how Young&#39;s method allows us to find the transition matrix <span>$\Gamma_t$</span>, before illustrating the application of the method to the calculation of the steady state, as well as the movement of the distribution over time. In line with the former section, we use the expressions <span>$\vec b$</span>, <span>$\vec k$</span>, and <span>$\vec h$</span> for the exogenously given vectors over which we discretize the continuous state space, and <span>$n_b$</span>, <span>$n_k$</span>, and <span>$n_h$</span> denote their respective sizes.</p><h3 id="Young&#39;s-method-applied"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Young&#39;s-method-applied">Young&#39;s method applied</a><a id="Young&#39;s-method-applied-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Young&#39;s-method-applied" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Written more abstractly, Young&#39;s method finds the transition matrix <span>$\Gamma_t$</span>, which allows expressing the dynamics of a distribution over the state space as:</p><p class="math-container">\[\Theta_{t+1}(b, k, h) = \Theta_t(b, k, h) \Gamma_t. \tag{LOM Distribution}\]</p><p class="math-container">\[\Gamma_t\]</p><p>is the transition matrix that maps households from today&#39;s state space to tomorrow&#39;s state space.

Since the policy functions yield continuous, off-grid values, Young&#39;s method employs linear interpolation between grid points to find the weights for redistributing agents from today&#39;s state space to tomorrow&#39;s state space. This ensures that the redistribution maintains the same mean as the policy function. The figure below (Figure 1 in Young (2010)) illustrates the intuition behind the method.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header">Note</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Young&#39;s model differs from the model we use. Young illustrates the methodology for a Krusell and Smith economy, where households have two idiosyncratic states <span>$\varepsilon_t$</span>. Households can either be employed (<span>$\varepsilon_t = e$</span>) or unemployed (<span>$\varepsilon_t = u$</span>). Households fluctuate between idiosyncratic states according to <span>$\pi_{\varepsilon_t \varepsilon_{t+1}}$</span>. Facing the idiosyncratic risk, households optimally choose their savings in the liquid asset <span>$k$</span>, with the policy function being denoted as <span>$g(k_t, \varepsilon_t)$</span>.

The arrows indicate the optimal choice of <span>$k^* = g(k_t, \varepsilon_t)$</span> for each type as colored dots at the top two lines. For example, households at the illustrated grid point <span>$k$</span> that are employed (<span>$\varepsilon_t = e$</span>) would like to save <span>$g(k, e)$</span>, illustrated by the purple and teal dots. However, this optimal savings decision lies between grid points illustrated in blue, requiring us to find weights <span>$\omega$</span> for the neighboring grid points. These weights ensure that the policy choice is accurately represented as a gamble over grid points. By doing so, we preserve the values of the policy functions for each individual point in the state space <span>$(b, k, h)$</span>. Finally, we weight the measure of agents transitioning between each state <span>$\varepsilon_t$</span> and <span>$\varepsilon_{t+1}$</span> using <span>$\pi_{\varepsilon_t, \varepsilon_{t+1}}$</span>, which denotes the transition probability of individual states.</p><p>Having illustrated the intuition based on Young&#39;s original model, we now apply the methodology to determine the individual elements of the transition matrix <span>$\Gamma_t$</span> in our specific context.</p><p>Consider a generic period <span>$t$</span> during the simulation, with the current distribution over the discretized state-space <span>$\Theta_t(b,k,h)$</span>. Associated with the distribution are policy functions <span>$b^{*}_a(b, k, h)$</span>, <span>$b^{*}_n(b, k, h)$</span>, and <span>$k^{*}_a(b,k,h)$</span>. Given these policy functions, we need to locate them within the grids. Specifically, for both the adjustment and non-adjustment cases, we need to find the indices <span>$j_b$</span> and <span>$j_k$</span> such that <span>$b^{*}_i(b, k, h) \in [\vec b_{j_b}, \vec b_{{j_b}+1}]$</span> for <span>$i \in [a, n]$</span>, and <span>$k^{*}_a(b, k, h) \in [\vec k_{j_k}, \vec k_{{j_k}+1}]$</span>. Essentially, we are identifying the indices <span>$j_b$</span> and <span>$j_k$</span> on the exogenous grids <span>$\vec b$</span> and <span>$\vec k$</span> that are closest but lower than the values of the policy functions.</p><p>We want to relocate the current mass <span>$\Theta_t (b, k, h)$</span> to the points <span>$(\vec b_{j_b}, \vec k_{j_k}, h&#39;)$</span>, <span>$(\vec b_{j_b + 1}, \vec k_{j_k}, h&#39;)$</span>, <span>$(\vec b_{j_b}, \vec k_{j_k + 1}, h&#39;)$</span>, and <span>$(\vec b_{j_b + 1}, \vec k_{j_k + 1}, h&#39;)$</span> according to the weights <span>$\omega_b \omega_k \Pi(h, h&#39;)$</span>, <span>$(1 - \omega_b) \omega_k \Pi(h, h&#39;)$</span>, <span>$\omega_b (1 - \omega_k) \Pi(h, h&#39;)$</span>, and <span>$(1 - \omega_b)(1 - \omega_k) \Pi(h, h&#39;)$</span>, with <span>$\Pi(h,h&#39;)$</span> denoting the transition probability between idiosyncratic states.</p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{align*}

Note that the policy function for the illiquid asset in the non-adjustment case is <span>$k^*_n (b, k, h) = k$</span>, such that <span>$\omega_k (b, k, h, n) = 1$</span>. The weights determine the measure of agents who move to the discrete realizations of the state space <span>$(b, k, h)$</span>, and the <span>$\omega$</span>&#39;s are then a reassignment of individuals to the endpoints of the interval, where the weights are determined by how close the true decision rule lies to each endpoint.

This does not imply, however, that households do not move over the state space. Due to idiosyncratic risk and optimal choices, households still fluctuate over the discretized state space. However, because prices are constant, the policy functions are also time-invariant. This implies that the transition matrix <span>$\Gamma_t$</span> is time-invariant as well.

The future state space location is referred to as the <code>targetindex</code>, and the probability <span>$\gamma^i_{(b, k, h) \rightarrow (b&#39;, k&#39;, h&#39;)}$</span> that a household transitions there is called the <code>weight</code>. This process is done separately for the adjustment and non-adjustment cases.</p><p>Below, we illustrate the adjustment case, which is slightly more complex than the non-adjustment case. In the adjustment case, households choose two asset policies. For each policy choice, the realization of the policy function lies between two grid points for either the liquid or the illiquid asset. Unlike the illustration based on Young&#39;s example above, we need to interpolate two policy choices between four grid points in the liquid-illiquid state-space. Given indices <span>$j_{b_a}$</span> and <span>$j_{k_a}$</span>, we need to calculate the weights associated with transitioning to the locations in the state space <span>$(j_{b_a}, j_{k_a})$</span>, <span>$(j_{b_a}, j_{k_a}+1)$</span>, <span>$(j_{b_a}+1, j_{k_a})$</span>, and <span>$(j_{b_a}+1, j_{k_a}+1)$</span>.</p><p>We initialize the containers for the variables that we aim to fill within a loop:</p><pre><code class="language-Julia hljs">weight_adj =

The key difference from the steady state case is that the transition matrix is no longer time-invariant. This is because the policy functions change as a function of the current position in the state-space. With the policy functions at the current realization of the state variables at hand, the calculation of the transition matrix remains the same, and we can find the next period&#39;s distribution by matrix multiplication as in the law of motion of the distribution (see eq. (LOM distribution)). However, since we solve the economy using classical perturbation methods, it is impractical to include a large matrix multiplication, as the multiplication must be repeated each time we take derivatives of the entire system.</p><p>When finding the new distribution in the file <a href="../PerturbationSolution/#BASEforHANK.PerturbationSolution.Fsys"><code>BASEforHANK.PerturbationSolution.Fsys()</code></a> within the function <code>Fsys</code>, we employ a slightly different approach. Using the previous period&#39;s distribution <span>$\Theta_t$</span>, we directly compute the next period&#39;s distribution <span>$\Theta_{t+1}$</span> in the function <code>DirectTransition</code>. Intuitively, we calculate the transition probabilities <span>$\gamma^i_{(b, k, h) \rightarrow (b&#39;, k&#39;, h&#39;)}$</span> and directly distribute the current mass of households at each point in the state space to the next period&#39;s distribution. We can perform both operations in a single loop iteration, as today&#39;s mass, the transition probability, and the future location in the distribution are all functions of today&#39;s position in the state space.</p><p>The implementation is illustrated below. First, we calculate the indeces and (right-hand-side) weights associated with the policy functions using <code>MakeWeightsLight</code>, which is an optimized version of the <code>MakeWeights</code> function. Moreover, we again use the <code>blockindex</code> to be able to use linear indexing.</p><pre><code class="language-Julia hljs">j_k_a, ω_right_k_a = MakeWeightsLight(k_a_star, n_par.grid_k)

j_b_n, ω_right_b_n = MakeWeightsLight(b_n_star, n_par.grid_b)

blockindex = (0:(n_par.nh - 1)) * n_par.nk * n_par.nb</code></pre><p>Second, we iterate over the entire state space today to calculate the next period&#39;s distribution. This is done in several substeps:</p><ol><li><p>Extract the current mass of households <code>dd</code> and calculate the (linear) indices that the policy functions for assets map to (<code>j_adj</code> and <code>j_non</code>).</p></li><li><p>Calculate the mass of households that transition to asset grid points in the next period for both the adjustment and non-adjustment cases.</p></li><li><p>Apply the transition probability for productivity and distribute households according to the policy functions and the transition matrix of productivity over tomorrow&#39;s state space.</p></li></ol><p>The first step uses the indices calculated above and is, with exception to the extraction of the distribution, identical to the approach in <code>MakeTransition</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-Julia hljs">dd = distr[bb, kk, hh]

end</code></pre><p>The last step differs only from the generation of the transition matrix <span>$\Gamma_t$</span> in <code>MakeTransition</code> in that it directly multiplies the mass of the distribution to the respective transition probabilities <span>$\gamma^i_{(b, k, h) \rightarrow (b&#39;, k&#39;, h&#39;)}$</span>.</p><p>When iterating over the entire state space in the loop, we calculate the masses of households that transition from today&#39;s state space to tomorrow&#39;s state space, correctly weighted to account for their policy functions, the ability to adjust illiquid assets, and productivity realizations. By adding these masses to the initially empty <code>dPrime</code> array, we aggregate the masses of households that transition into the same point in the next period&#39;s distribution, even if they originate from different points in today&#39;s state space.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../examples/baseline/">« Baseline example</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.10.2 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Tuesday 29 April 2025 08:40">Tuesday 29 April 2025</span>.
